      <p class="sport">I am a big fan of both cricket and football. I think they are both so             much fun to watch and play. Cricket is a sport where you have to think fast and make           good decisions. You want to score as many runs as you can, and you also want to                get the other team's players "out". Football is all about running and kicking the              ball. The players are so fast and strong, and they work together to try and score              goals. I love to watch both of these sports, and I also like to talk to my friends             about them. When there's a big match on, I can't wait to see what's going to happen!           These sports make me feel so excited and happy.</p>
